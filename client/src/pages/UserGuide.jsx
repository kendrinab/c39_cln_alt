            they use every day. Unlike other ingredient databases, we focus
            exclusively on the chemical content of the products in question. We
            have consciously avoided the widely-used practice of “greenwashing”,
            whereby the environmental or social responsibility of a product’s
            manufacturer is factored into the assessment allowing a product to
            receive an artificially low toxicity rating. We remain an
            independent company with no affiliate to any other third parties. We
            are solely concerned about the possible impact of a given product on
            an individual’s health, and our ratings methodology reflects that
            singular commitment.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Our ratings</strong> are determined based on publicly
            available data released by non-profit and government agencies in
            North America regarding the health and safety of the individual
            components found in your personal care products.
